#PYTHON LOGIN INTERFACE USING TKINTER GUI

Here i have created a login form using Tkinter GUI library in which i have used a default  username [abcd@gmail.com] and password[abc123]  you can change it as per your need.

I have applied a Empty Validation means if you left blank either Username or Password then you will get a message "fill the empty field!!!" after pressing button

When you will enter wrong Username or Password then you will get a message "wrong username or password!!!" after pressing button.

Widgets used to create Login Form

1.Label
2.TextBox or EditText(Entry)
3.PasswordField
4.Button
